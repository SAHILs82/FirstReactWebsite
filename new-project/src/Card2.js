           <p>
               JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is simply a 
               syntax extension of JavaScript. It allows us 
               to directly write HTML in React (within JavaScript code). 
               It is easy to create a template using JSX in React, 
               but it is not a simple template language instead it comes with t
               he full power of JavaScript
